🧩 Branding Consistency Checker

A Java + MongoDB application for verifying brand attribute consistency across content.


---

📘 Overview

The Branding Consistency Checker is a conceptual Java project that validates whether brand-related elements — such as brand name, slogan, and primary color — in a given piece of content match the official branding data stored in MongoDB.

It helps ensure brand uniformity across marketing materials, web content, and media assets.

This example demonstrates core branding validation logic and basic MongoDB interaction using the official Java driver.


---

⚙ Features

✅ Stores official brand profiles in MongoDB (as a Master Profile).
✅ Automatically initializes the database with a default brand (BrandX).
✅ Checks given content against the master profile.
✅ Detects inconsistencies in:

Brand name

Slogan

Primary color (hex code)


✅ Provides clear and readable report messages for consistency results.
✅ Demonstrates MongoDB CRUD operations and Java data modeling.


---

🧠 Conceptual Workflow

1. MongoDB Initialization

Connects to BrandingDB database.

Checks if the master profile (BrandX) exists.

If not, inserts it automatically.



2. Master Profile Retrieval

Fetches the official brand attributes.



3. Content Validation

Compares provided content attributes to the official profile.

Reports mismatches (e.g., different colors, slogans, or name formats).



4. Display Results

Prints a detailed summary of consistency checks for multiple content samples.
